# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Study Guide was created for OSU boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on the HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript taught within the Prework modules. Through completing this project we learned the basics of coding and how to use the Github workflow.  Any student of this project can use this Study Guide and refer to some of the important tips for the covered topics.
